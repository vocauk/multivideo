Play lyric and normal hologram video at the same time.

## About

This is a very, very rough script to run the VOCA-UK concerts file by file.

## Installation

1. Download this repository
2. Fill out the folderPath in the play.bat
3. Run "play.bat 1 2 "Do My Best""

## Usage Explanation

The first argument is the monitor the lyric video will display on, and the second is the one the hologram will display on. The third argument is the video, and optionally the fourth is a sleep timeout for if something is going terribly wrong.

This is an archive of the prototype developed for MultiVideo.
